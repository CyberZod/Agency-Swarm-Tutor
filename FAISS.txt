That’s a solid plan! Here's how the QA Agent would work in your Agency Swarm setup:

🔹 Workflow Overview
ScraperAgent scrapes a website and stores the file paths in shared state. ✅ (Already Done)

QA Agent takes these markdown files, processes them, and uploads them to a vector database.

When a user asks a question, the QA Agent retrieves relevant context from the vector DB and answers using an LLM.

🔹 Tech Stack Choices
To implement this, we’ll need:

FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) → for fast vector-based retrieval.

LangChain → for LLM-based question answering.

OpenAI Embeddings API → to convert text into vectors.

🔹 How the QA Agent Works
1️⃣ Upload Scraped Data to the Vector Store
Reads the .md files from shared state.

Converts them into vector embeddings using OpenAI.

Stores them in FAISS for fast retrieval.

2️⃣ Answer User Questions
Converts the user's question into a vector.

Finds the most relevant context from FAISS.

Passes the context + question to an LLM to generate the answer.
